                Since you're moving to a different country, <br>
                filled with new people and places, and with <br>
                all your studies on top, it might be overwhelming<br>
                at first, but don't let it get a hold of you. Just <br>
                have faith in the Lord and yourself, and itâ€™ll be <br>
                alright. You can do it, for if there's anyone <br>
                I know who's strong enough to get through it all,<br>
                It's you. But just remember to take good care of <br>
                yourself first, because someday you will be taking <br>
                care of others and saving their lives. For that, <br>
                you have to take care of yourself now. I pray that<br>
                each one of your endeavors in life leads to success. <br>
                "I wish you immense success <br>
                with your studies Dr.Roni ."
